In this game, you will control a spaceship to shoot down aliens meanwhile 
trying to avoid their projectile.

## Gameplay

   respectively. Press "Space" to shoot.
2. For each alien shot, the player is awarded 100 points.
3. In each round, the aliens will gradually advance closer to the spaceship. If the aliens cross the boundary (the line that separates the spaceship from    the aliens), player will lose one life and restart the current round.
4. The aliens can shoot too. It's the player's job to avoid their projectile.
   If the player is hit, player will lose one life and restart the current 
   round.
5. To proceed to next round, the player has to clear all aliens in the 
   current round. Aliens move faster and faster after each round.

   and the player will have to restart the game from the beginning.
